# Planning phase explined

During the planning phase we capture requirements, business use cases and business 
processes. We also define the scope of the project and the project goals.
De planning phase is not executed in a single step. It is an iterative process 
where we continuously refine the requirements and the scope of the project. 
As a result of the planning phase we have many tasks that need to be executed. 
These tasks are captured in the backlog of the project.

All tasks are written down in the backlog of the project in GitHub Projects. They are with priority
and are planned in 1week sprints. The backlog is the single source of truth for the project.
